-----Feedback regarding flow 2-------
During the flow 2 we have learned Threads and Networking. 
From our team point of view, Threading should've been given more attention. 
Attention in regards to receiving more feedback from our exercises. We do understand
the theory, but when doing it in practice, it becomes trickier. 
Regarding the Neworking class we grasped the whole idea. 
But, again, when we had to develop more complicated clients with Threading
for example, we have felt a bit of a hitwall due to bad performance on last's
week in Threading. 
Overall, we managed to complete the assignments and the CA-2 assignmet with the 
help of a more diverse team. Each providing full knowledge in their domain.
